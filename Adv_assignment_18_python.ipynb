    "Binary files provide a layer of security as they are not human-readable. Also, in text files, each digit of a number is considered as a character and stored as 1 byte. So, even though an integer should occupy 4 bytes, a number 12432 in a text file will consume 5 * 1 byte treating each digit as a character. Instead, a binary file will store exactly 4 bytes for an integer. So it is more memory-efficient."
