    "Implicit exception chaining: If exceptions are chained, e.g. the except block of a function calls another function that itself raises a different type of exception. If the first function throws an error, it goes to the except block which calls this function, which raises another exception. The original exception is stored in the __ context __ variable. This helps in debugging.\n",
